# Browser Reminder
A simple chrome extension to remind you of a task periodically

## Purpose

This extension blanks your tab every N (20) seconds and shows a message popup for M (6) seconds. The intention is to remind you that you have been browsing for a long time and you need to take a break - drink water, for example. 20 and 6 were picked for demo sake - half an hour intervals would be more realistic.

Timing and message is hardcoded and I will make them configurable soon.
